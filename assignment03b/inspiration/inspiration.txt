The game im trying to make is inspired by one of the 'modules' in a game called "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes". 
It is a 2-player game where one player has the layout of the maze and the other player has the character and objective's position. 
They must communicate without seeing the other's screen to solve the maze.
I want to make a game similar to that 
I'd like to have different mazes every game
The real game is under time constraints so I woukd like to make something of that sort.
I also plan to make it single player and add my own twist to it
